**Document-based Q&A System**
This project is a Document-based Question & Answer (Q&A) System utilizing advanced language models and embeddings. It allows users to upload a document and ask questions, receiving answers based on the content of the uploaded document. The system is built using the following technologies:

Hugging Face Models: For language understanding and generation.
Llama Index: For creating vector store indices and managing embeddings.
Gradio: For creating a user-friendly web interface.
Features
Login to Hugging Face: The system requires a Hugging Face token for access to models.
Document Loading: Users can upload documents, which are then processed to extract relevant information.
Language Model Initialization: The system uses the Llama-2-7b-chat-hf model from Meta Llama, which is fine-tuned for chat and Q&A tasks.
Embedding Model: The Sentence Transformers model (all-mpnet-base-v2) is used to create embeddings of the document content.
Service Context Creation: This sets up the necessary context for querying the language model and embeddings.
Vector Store Index Creation: The document is indexed using vector embeddings, facilitating efficient information retrieval.
Query Processing: Users can ask questions, and the system will return answers based on the indexed document.
